# Aurora
 Connecting Students to Volunteering.

 ### Story/Rationale

 Within Canada, we need a total of 40 hours to graduate from High School. However, manyh high school students have trouble finding volunteering opportunities due to the lack of a centralized website. These students also lack time and information, making it difficult for volunteering organizations to reach them. Finally, even when they can find opportunities, they are often uninteresting to the students due to a lack of choice. Aurora aims to solve these problems by allowing volunteers to search a database for suitable and interesting opportunities, while enjoying a gamified experience. 

 ### What does Aurora Do?

 Organizations can post their opportunities for volunteering on this platform and connect with volunteers who are seeking for these popportunities. Aurora makes the whole process of looking for a volunteering opportunity simple by unifying the whole platform and industry together and creating a new platform that makes the volunteering experience of High School a much mroe enjoyable process.

 ### How does it work?

 #### Front-End

  The Front-end User Interface was built ontop of React and Vite for high speed rendering and for reactive UI.

 #### Back-End
 
  On the backend side, there exists 4 different backends to serve for all 4 current backend cloud server nodes, functioning similarily to a blockchain but much more dynamic. The blockchain system diverts from the current and traditional approaches to a blockchain, the system implemented in Aurora uses cloud computing databases that function as nodes or blocks within a blockchain, allowing the databases to have high performacne and reading speeds while maintaining the security functions of a traditional blockchain. The specialties of this system include bieng high secure; Blockchain hackers will not be familiar with this system, average database injections will automatimcally be secured and deflected from the methods of our Pseudo-Blockchain.

 #### API

  We utilized Axios for linking the **Front-end** and **Back-end** together, each time one request is being sent out, the Axios API will braodcast the API across every cloud server that is available at the time, allowing all servers to be set as both a current database and a backup database while needing next to no maintenance.
